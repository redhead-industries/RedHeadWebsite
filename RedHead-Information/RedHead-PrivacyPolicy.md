**Last updated:** January 12th, 2026. - 7:15 PM Eastern Standard Time.

RedHead Industries respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and—most importantly—how we **do not** exploit it.

Our approach to privacy is simple: **collect as little data as possible, use it responsibly, and never treat people as products**.

## 1. Who We Are

RedHead Industries is a Canadian, community-first, non-profit, open-source–driven organization. Our website exists to share information about our projects, philosophy, and ways to support our work.

We do not operate as an advertising platform, data broker, or surveillance-driven service.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily

We only collect personal information when you **choose** to provide it, such as:

- Contact information (e.g., email address) if you reach out to us directly
- Information you include in messages, emails, or forms
- Optional details you provide when donating or collaborating

You are never required to provide personal information just to browse our website.

### 2.2 Information Collected Automatically

By default, RedHead Industries **does not**:

- Track users across websites
- Build behavioral profiles

Like most websites, basic server logs may temporarily record limited technical data such as:

- IP address

- Date and time of access

This information is used **solely for security, abuse prevention, and basic operational integrity**, and is not used to identify individuals.

RedHead Industries does **not** use:

- Advertising cookies
- Cross-site tracking cookies
- Fingerprinting technologies

If cookies are used at all, they are limited to **strictly necessary functionality** (for example, remembering a preference you explicitly set).

We do not use cookies to track you, profile you, or sell data.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Some services linked from our website may be operated by third parties, such as:

## 6. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade personal information.

We only share information if:

If disclosure is legally required, we will comply **only to the minimum extent necessary**.

---

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal information **only for as long as necessary** to fulfill its original purpose, or as required by law.

When information is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized.

---

## 8. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information against:
