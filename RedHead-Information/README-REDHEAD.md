## 👋 Welcome to **RedHead Industries**

### *By the people. For the people.*

RedHead Industries is an independent Canadian organization founded by **Matthew DaLuz**, dedicated to building **free and open-source (FOSS)** software, games, and open research — all focused on **privacy, transparency, and equality**.

Our philosophy is simple: everyone deserves access to powerful, high-quality software and innovation without being exploited, tracked, or silenced.

At RedHead, we aren’t a corporation chasing profit — we’re a movement of developers, creators, and thinkers building technology **for humanity**.

## 🏗️ Our Structure

RedHead consists of two key branches, each working toward the same vision of a freer and fairer digital and physical world:

### 🖥️ RedHead Technologies

Focused on developing open-source software, games, and hardware prototypes.
We aim to bring AAA-quality design, performance, and transparency to the open-source community — from utility tools to full-fledged entertainment and productivity software.

### 🔬 RedHead Open-Research

Dedicated to innovative and open research.
This information is a work-in-progress.

## 📜 Our Story

Founded in **2015** by Matthew, RedHead began as a small book and comic publishing company before evolving into a game development studio.

Between **2019–2020**, we worked to recreate the PlayStation classic ***Vib-Ribbon*** as a fan-made open-source project called **Vib-Ribbon+**. Although the project was later cancelled due to internal challenges, its development shaped the foundation of RedHead’s open-source philosophy.

In **2024**, RedHead was reborn — this time with a greater mission: to build transparent, community-powered technology that respects freedom and privacy. Every project we create is released under open-source licenses and shaped by direct community feedback.

## 🌐 Our Beliefs

* **Privacy is a right**, not a privilege.
* **Freedom of speech** and **open access** to information are essential for progress.
* **Transparency** builds trust — our code, goals, and methods will always remain open.
* **Community** comes before profit.

We are **your neighbors, your coworkers, your friends — and the voices that refuse to be silenced.**

## 💸 Support RedHead

RedHead operates fully independently and **relies on community donations** to keep our website, domain, and projects alive.
We accept **Bitcoin**, **Monero**, and **Ko-fi** donations.

> 💡 *We prefer Bitcoin/Monero due to Stripe’s unreliability at this time.*

You can find all of our donation methods here:

## 🚀 The Future

We’re still growing and setting up new systems — including developer tools, community hubs, and collaborative spaces.
RedHead is **not yet a registered business**, but we plan to officially register as a **non-profit organization by February 2026**.
